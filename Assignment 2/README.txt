i) All parts of the assignment were completed, following the comments in testTree.cpp and queryTree.cpp, and being able to print all of the required output successfully and query, respectively. No error occurs based on my computation. If there is a possible error, it would be that I possibly calculated the average Depth wrong, but otherwise as far as actual programming goes, the code should work. 

ii) No bugs based on the instructions given were found.

iii) When compiling on a Linux terminal, with the files on your home/user folder/folder where you put the files in your directory, you can simply write:
make all
./queryTree rebase210.txt FLAG (where FLAG = BST, AVL, and LazyAVL)
./testTree rebase210.txt sequences.txt FLAG (where FLAG = BST, AVL, and LazyAVL)
		
iv) The input files are rebase210.txt and sequences.txt. There are no output files.
