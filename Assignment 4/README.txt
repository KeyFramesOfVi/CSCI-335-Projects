i. All parts of the assignment were completed, minus part 6 which was extra credit.
ii. There are no bugs based on my knowledge. There may be a slight miscounting or over counting of the assignment and comparisons, but the program runs fine and does all tasks correctly.

./testMyQueue <word file name> (words.txt was used for this assignment)
