i. All parts of the assignment were completed.
ii. There are no bugs in my code as far as I can tell, unless for testMyHashMap, where i made the size 100000000 and my
laptop crashed. However, this is probably more of a laptop constraint than an actual bug.
iii. First, type make all to start the makefile. After it is done compiling:
./HashTest will run the QuadraticProbing hash test.
./testMaps <word file name> (words.txt was used for this assignment)
./testMyHashMap <word file name> <Hashmap size> (words.txt was used for this assignment)
iv. The input file used was words.txt, which would be the word file name that you can use 
to test.
